## How it works ?

[**Boggle**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) is a [word game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_game) invented by Allan Turoff and originally distributed by [Parker Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Brothers). The game is played using a grid of letters, in which the players attempt to find words in sequences of adjacent letters. 



Basically, The player searches for words that can be constructed from the letters of sequentially adjacent cubes, where "adjacent" cubes are those  horizontally, vertically and diagonally neighboring. Words must be at  least three letters long, may include singular and plural (or other derived forms) separately. The application records all the words that is submitted by the players. After **three minutes** have elapsed, the application stops the player from the game play and the game enters the scoring phase.
